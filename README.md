# Description

This repository provides the code for our research paper, which was presented at the 7th International Conference at Ankara Bilim University on February 9, 2024.

With the growing population of the world, global warming is also increasing, emphasizing the need for a clean and green environment. Therefore, analyzing air quality is becoming increasingly important.

Due to the importance of air quality analysis, many approaches have been proposed in this context. The new advancement in Deep Learning, Transformers, has completely changed the world of AI, especially in the field of NLP. In this project, we perform a comparative analysis between Encoder-Decoder Transformers, Encoder-only, and Decoder-only Transformer layers. The default structure of Transformers is a composition of Encoder and Decoder layers, where the Encoder is utilized for the source and the Decoder is utilized to predict values in the context of time-series datasets. For more details, the Abstract of the article is available below.

# Abstract
Utilizing Internet of Things (IoT) devices in the modern world helps humans with industrialization, benefits from IoT devices in industry, and increases air pollution levels in emerging nations. One of the pollutants generated daily is particle pollution, commonly known as Particulate Matter (PM), consisting of tiny solid or liquid particles suspended in the air. These particles, including dust, dirt, and soot, are generated by IoT devices and can have adverse effects on human health. Therefore, numerous researchers have undertaken studies to examine the influence of air pollution on human health and to devise efficient techniques for predicting and managing air quality. Today, data scientists are deeply engaged in leveraging Deep Learning (DL) algorithms to address and mitigate concerns related to air quality. One of the most recent advancements in DL is Transformer networks, which propose an attention-based mechanism inspired by the human brain's ability to store previous information, outperforming in sequential data. The original structure of vanilla Transformers comprises encoder and decoder layers. However, the Encoder and Decoder layers can be used separately in various IoT time-series data analyzing tasks. In this study, we conduct a comparative analysis among Encoder-only, Decoder-only, as well as the Enc&Dec Transformer to evaluate the models' performance in air quality prediction. The experimental evaluations have been conducted on the Beijing Multi-site Air Quality (BMAQ) dataset. As a result, the Enc&Dec Transformer outperformed Encoder-only and Decoder-only transformers with an MSE of 0.061, RMSE of 0.25, MAE of 0.13, and an R2 of 0.93.
